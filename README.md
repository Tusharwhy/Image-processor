Image Processing Web Server with Real-Time Preview
## Objective:

Build a full-stack image processing web application that accepts image uploads in various formats (PNG or JPEG), processes them on the backend, and provides real-time previews of the manipulated image (lower quality for speed). Users should be able to download the final processed image in their desired format (PNG or JPEG).

### Tools & Technologies:

- Backend: Node.js, Express, Sharp (Image processing), TypeScript
- Frontend: React, Context API, TypeScript
